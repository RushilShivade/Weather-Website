# Weather-Website
Weather website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

This is a simple project I did while learning frontend web development. 
This project uses 'Weather by API-Ninjas' to fetch the weather when queried.
The output is a compilation of weather stastistics like temperature, feels like, wind, max and min temp. etc.
